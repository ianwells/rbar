Here are the extrapolated revenues for a bunch of liquor license holders in Houston, TX.  Compare bars!  Compare neighborhoods!  See the rise and fall and rise of the downtown bar scene!

#Compare to Interesting Events

This data comes from http://www.window.state.tx.us/taxinfo/taxfiles.html

They request that I add this notice:

"The Comptroller of Public Accounts cannot vouch for the data or analysis derived from data after it has been retrieved from the Comptroller's Web site."
